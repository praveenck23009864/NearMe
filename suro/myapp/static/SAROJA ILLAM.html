        A home, or domicile, is a space used as a permanent or semi-permanent
        residence for one or more human occupants, and sometimes various
        companion animals. It is a fully- or semi-sheltered space and can have
        both interior and exterior aspects to it. Homes provide sheltered
        spaces, for instance rooms, where domestic activity can be performed
        such as sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene as well as
        providing spaces for work and leisure such as remote working, studying
        and playing.</font>
