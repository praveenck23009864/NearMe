         feel God's presence.n traditional Christian architecture, the plan view of a church often forms a Christian 
         cross with the center aisle and seating representing the vertical beam and the bema and altar forming the horizontal. 
         Towers or domes may inspire contemplation of the heavens. Modern churches have a variety of architectural styles and 
         layouts. Some buildings designed for other purposes  have been converted to churches, while many original church buildings
          have been put to other uses.</font>
