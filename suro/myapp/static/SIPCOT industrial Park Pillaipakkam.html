         SIPCOT has rendered fruitful services to the state by identifying, developing, maintaining
         Industrial Areas in backward and most backward taluk of the State, which had the potential to grow. Establish, develop, maintain and manage Industrial Complexes, parks and growth centres at various places 
         across the State of Tamil Nadu. SIPCOT's role in assisting the industrialization in the State is not only quantitative but also qualitative.
         Instead of just accelerating the pace of industrial growth in already developed and densely populated areas, SIPCOT, as a nodal agency, strives 
         to ensure that disbursal of financial incentives result in spurt of industrial growth in backward and areas yet to develop.
         To ensure a good impact with the available limited resources, SIPCOT has created Industrial Complexes and Parks, strategically located in 
         twenty one places and twelve Districts, which occupy a place of pride in the State's industrial map.
         Very cooperative people. Good Service to public.
         Well connected with major roads and lot of land area</font>
